Reflection: 

I attended a TA hour on Tuesday September 26 and Wednesday night and consulted with Ngoc Dang who explained and assisted me with debugging my transcription and random response code. Ngoc taught me how to code a lot more efficiently with finding the random letter. Originally, I had a random number variable and then several if-statements for each number. She taught me to use an array and then randomly call on the 

I also went to office hour on Tuesday September 26 and learned about the split() method. My original plan was doing substrings and inserting each word into an array, but I ran into errors. After I went to TA hours, I learned about split() method which made my code clearer and a lot more efficient. 

I also consulted with Dani Justo from section 02 CSC 120 and we wrote the pseudocode and the for the basic "mhm, mhm" chatbox. Then we helped each other throughout the assignment with debugging the code, such as when the transcript array had errors. She also helped me with debugging my Random value. 

My inital impression of Java is that it is very complex. For example, to print, I have to type System.out.println(...). Also for the Scanner test, we have to import the Scanner and instantiate it which is a lot more steps. However, I think because Java requires more information and does not assume things, it makes it easier for me to understand what variables are and what it is trying to do. 

While Java is more complex, Python is more flexible, and does not need programemrs to be explicit in their code. It is also a lot simpler and a lot less rules in its syntax. 

Overall, the chatbox is running. It is also able to print random responses and print the transcript. Some things that I would improve is input validation, such as the computer being able to re-ask the "How many rounds: " question if the input is not an integer and is a negative number or another dataType. One thing I would also do is make it into OOP and have different methods. 

One advice I would suggest is to attend TA and office hours. I was struggling a lot with debugging, but after going to TA hours to get help, I was able to run the code and did not have to struggle in silence alone.
